# WebSocket
## Introduction
This project is a fork on [@katzarsky/WebSocket](https://github.com/katzarsky/WebSocket).
Actually, I has fixed some bugs in it.
## Attention
* If you were trying to build a websocket server, you must make sure that you have received correctly. Because in this project, we do not provide receive method.
